Use Case 6: Determine Car Position
Scenario 6A: Car moves from hallway f on floor x to adjacent hallway g on floor y and stops.
Author name: Leikai Ma
Pre-Conditions:
	Car is at hallway [f, b].
	All elevator doors are closed.
	Car is moving in hoistway.
Scenario:
	Drive starts to go slow
	Car arrives at floor y and AtFloor[y, g] becomes true
	Drive starts to go level
	Drive starts to go stop

Post-Conditions
	Door is closed
	Drive is stopped
	Elevator is at floor y




Use Case 8: Move Car to Next Floor

Scenario 8A: Elevator moves from {floor f, hallway b} to {floor g, hallway c} in direction d.

Note: You will want to create other scenarios that involve fast speed for your elevator, but this is a starting point.

Pre-Conditions:

	Elevator is at floor f, with at least one Door[b,r] open.
	Drive is stopped.
Scenario:
	Door[b,r] closes
	Drive starts to go slow in direction of d to floor g
	Drive speeds up to fast
	Car reaches the commit point of floor g
	Drive slows down
	Drive starts to go level
	Drive starts to go stop

Post-Conditions:
	Door[b, r] is closed
	Drive is stopped
	Elevator is at floor g

Use Case 9: Cycle Doors

Scenario 9A: Elevator stops at hallway and doors open. Dispatcher computes next desired floor just as doors open. Doors close.

Note: This dispatcher is really dumb and stops at every floor, in order. It would be much better to stop only at floors with people on them or that people want to go to.

Pre-Conditions:

	Car is stopped.
	AtFloor[f,b] was last received as True.
	All doors are closed.
Scenario:
	Door[b, r] opens
	Dispatcher computes the next desired floor
	Door[b, r] closes

Post-Conditions:
	Door[b, r] is closed
	Car is still stopped
	Elevator is still at floor f
